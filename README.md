# OpenRad - AI Radiology Report Generator

OpenRad is a modern, responsive web application designed for radiologists and medical professionals to generate, review, and manage AI-assisted radiology reports. It connects a sleek frontend interface with your choice of AI workflow platforms (like n8n) and uses Supabase for cloud data persistence, alongside local caching for blazing-fast performance.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Report Generation**: Upload a medical image (X-Ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound), input patient details, and receive an AI-drafted standard medical report.
- **Hybrid Storage Model**:
  - **Cloud Sync**: Securely sync and manage reports via a Supabase PostgreSQL database.
  - **Local First**: Lightning-fast offline viewing and local caching using browser `localStorage`.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Native Dark and Light modes using modern Tailwind CSS v4 variables with dynamic theme switching that avoids UI flashing.
- **Report Templates**: Multiple structured report template styles (Standard, Modern, Minimal).
- **PDF Export**: Generate perfectly formatted medical PDF reports seamlessly.
- **Hospital Branding**: Add custom logos and hospital names directly to all generated exports.
- **User Management & Audit Logs**: Track who reviewed, approved, or rejected reports for medical compliance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, React 19)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Database Backend**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- **State Management**: React Hooks & Context + `localStorage`
- **PDF Generation**: `html2pdf.js`
- **Icons**: `lucide-react`

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Patient & Image Input**: The user uploads a medical image and fills out a clinical context form via the Next.js frontend.
2. **AI Inference**: The app triggers an external webhook (e.g., an n8n automated workflow) and sends the image/patient data. The webhook communicates with an AI model (like Google Gemini or OpenAI) to analyze the image and draft a structured report.
3. **Review & Edit**: The drafted report is returned to the app instantly. A medical professional reviews the findings, edits the content using the built-in rich text editor if necessary, and either Approves or Rejects the draft.
4. **Export & Storage**: Once approved, the report can be exported to a beautifully structured PDF. A copy is saved to the local browser storage, and if configured, synced remotely to the user's Supabase instance.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Configure Your Settings**: First, navigate to the **Settings** tab. Add your n8n Webhook URL (for the AI backend) and optionally your Supabase credentials for cloud syncing. You can also personalize your hospital branding and toggle dark/light mode here.

3. **Generate a Report**: Navigate to the **Dashboard**. Enter the patient's information (Name, Age, Gender), add the "Indication" for the scan, select the correct modality, and upload the image. Click "Generate Report".
4. **Analyze**: Wait a few seconds for the AI to return the draft. Review the detected findings, impression, and recommendations.
5. **Approve/Edit**: Read through the report. If anything needs adjusting, click the **Edit** button to make quick changes textually. Once satisfied, hit **Approve**.
6. **Download**: Click the **Download PDF** button to export the final result securely matching your chosen Template design.
